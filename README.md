# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends in successful funding of projects related to the arts. 
Based on the data, failed Kickstarter campaigns had higher goals than successful campaigns. The largest number of successful theater campaigns occurred in the months of May and June. The majority of campaigns in the subcategories of theater and plays were successful.

My recommendations for a Kickstarter campaign based on theater is to remain within a goal range of $1500 to $3000. I would suggest holding the campaign in the Summer; the months of May, June, and July are the most likely to be successful. For the future, the range of projects for musicals in Great Britain had a pledged range of $0 to roughly $1500. The high end was $3000, so I would recommend choosing a lower total goal for any musical projects.
